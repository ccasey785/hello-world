# hello-world

Good afternoon all. Ccasey785 here, and I am creating my first project here on GitHub! I am currently a student at the University of Phoenix, pursuing a BS in Information Technology. 
I am working towards completion and also attempting to gain additional knowledge in coding by using this website!
